# dynamical_planner

First steps: creation of GetStateWorld.py, talker.py and listener.py. 
GetStateWorld gets the state of the cubes from the world.
Talker is the publisher through which getStateWorld is sending the state to Planner.
Listener is the subscriber through which Planner receives the state information.
